# Sign-Language-Recognition-System
My project is an innovative  sign language product  designed to bridge  communication gaps and  enhance accessibility for  the deaf and hard-of-hearing community!
Developed a real-time sign language recognition application using TensorFlow and OpenCV to improve communication accessibility for the hearing impaired.
Implemented a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using Keras for accurate gesture recognition, achieving 85% accuracy on a validation set.
Integrated a real-time video capture feature that processes live input and displays the predicted sign language gesture on the screen.
Optimized model performance by applying data augmentation techniques, improving recognition accuracy by 15% compared to the initial model.
Created a user-friendly interface with Tkinter, enabling easy interaction with the system and testing various sign gestures.
